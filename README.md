## Work Experience
**Health Informatics Program Analyst  @ Veteran’s Health Administration (_August 2023- Pres_)**
- Designed and maintained SQL queries to improve electronic health record (EHR) functionality,  standardize processes, and enhance clinical decision-making.
- Streamlined operations by leveraging Power Automate to standardize processes and automate data workflows, resulting in improved efficiency and reduced manual effort.

**Informatics Dietitian  @ Veteran’s Health Administration (_July 2022 – August 2023_)**
- Analyzed KPI data for 100 VHA  nutrition departments, identifying trends using Power BI and Excel.
- Integrated two datasets with differing outputs into a centralized pipeline using PowerQuery, then delivered monthly Power BI presentations to leadership, providing valuable insights to support decision-making.

**Clinical Dietitian and Internship   @ Veteran’s Health Administration (_May 2021 – June 2022_)**
- Conducted statistical analysis using SPSS to compare the efficacy of virtual vs. in-person nutrition appointments, presenting findings to improve patient care strategies.
- Developed dynamic Excel dashboards to provide detailed macro- and micronutrient analyses for inpatient diets, used by leadership to audit and enhance processes.

## Projects
### Data-Driven Encounter Data 
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Sourced data from Synthea modeling after real world data. Uploaded data into SQL, analyzed using Postgres SQL. 
Developed dashboard for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.


### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
